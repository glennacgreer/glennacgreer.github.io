			I took the book and went outside to read for a while. Well, is it outside? I could look up and see the sky, but I was in the center of the building. There were walls all around me, closing me in, but there were plants in front of me, growing in the courtyard.

			There was this seating area that I sat down in. It was off to the side and there was this large, metal circle on the wall. It had things engraged in it. There was an inscription below the picture. It was about a woman, somehow. A woman named... something Davis. But I can't remember, what was the first part of her name?
