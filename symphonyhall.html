		That's right, I was going to a concert. There was already music playing outside when I got there. It was... Swan Lake. That's right, they were playing Swan Lake that night, and they were playing a recorded performance outside to set the mood. There were people going in, but not as many as I expected. For some reason, though, I didn't join them. There was some other sound that was distracting me drawing me away. It might not even have been real, but I kept hearing it under the pulse of the music. It might have been the sound of a <a href="symphonyhall.html">car</a>, or maybe an <a href="symphonyhall.html">airplane</a>, or perhaps even <a href="reflectionpool.html">water</a>, but I can't say for sure.
