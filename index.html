		<p> Hello? Is there someone there?</p>
		<p style="text-align:right;"><i>It's been a long time since I saw anyone.</i></p>
		<p style="text-align:center;">Something happened to me and I'm trying to remember what.</p>
		<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>But I can't do it on my own. I need someone to help me when I reach mental blocks, to set me on the right path.</strong></p>
		<p><strong><i>All I have are images, brief flashes of memory.</i></strong></p>
		<p style="text-align:right;">But I can't remember how they connect.</p>
		<p> Can you <a href="station.html">help?</a> </p>
