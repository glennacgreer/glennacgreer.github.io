			The library. That makes sense. After I got there, I wasn't sure what to do. I wandered around for a little while and came... here. I took a book off the shelf and just stood here for a minute, but in this memory, the book isn't here. It was the subtitle that really grabbed me, but I don't remember what it was. If only I could, I might be able to figure out what comes next.
